Angular-Firebase-Cordova-seed-with-simpleLogin
==============================================

An AngularJS and Firebase (with routing) seed generated by Yeoman, with Facebook simpleLogin 

## Getting started
Make sure you have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed with the [AngularJS-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) and the [AngularFire-generator](https://github.com/firebase/generator-angularfire). I also use [Cordova/Phonegap](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface) to build my webapp to native mobile platforms.

In this example I use android platform, Facebook login and routing in AngularJS.





## **1\.** Generate a seed and needed tools

```bash
cordova create loginExample com.example.hello AngularFireLogin
cd loginExample
cordova platform add android
mkdir dev && cd dev
yo angular
yo angularfire
```
#### Prompts asked on angularfire

 * `[?] Name of your Firebase instance:`
   (required) from your URL: http://`INSTANCE`.firebaseio.com
 * `[?] Shall I include FirebaseSimpleLogin?`
    Y
 * `[?] Which providers shall I install?`
   Facebook (select from a list of [simple login providers](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-overview.html) you have enabled for your Firebase)
 * `[?] Shall I include routeSecurity?`
    Y (allows you to specify `authRequired` on a route and force user to log in before they can view it)
 * `[?] Shall I create a rudimentary login screen?`
    Y (this creates views/login.html and controllers/login.js, which provide registration (for password auth) and authentication)

In loginExample/dev/app/views/login.html, remove "ng-cloak", or else the login won't display.


## **2\.** Enable authentication with Facebook in your application
 * Go to your forge at Firebase and click simpleLogin at the left bar. Enable Facebook.
 * Make an app at [Facebooks developers site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps). Take note of your App ID and App Secret.
 * In your Facebook application configuration, enable the 'Website with Facebook Login' integration and set your 'Site URL' to: https://auth.firebase.com/auth/facebook/callback
 

## **3\.** Build on mobile device with Cordova/Phonegap
 * Depending on what version of the generators, you may have to tweak some code and and add a logout button and a controller to it.
 * Remember to include in your index.html:
```javascript
<script src="cordova.js"></script> 
```
 * SimpleLogin requires inAppBrowser.
```bash
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
```
 * Build your code with **grunt build** and replace the code in your www folder with the files in your dist folder. Then it should be ready:
```bash
cordova run android
```
